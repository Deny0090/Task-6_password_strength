1.Passwords with Varying Complexity

weak: admin123  (Short, no symbols/caps. crack this password instantly)
Moderate: Jose123 (Predictable pattern.	Crack time Minutes to hours)
Strong: G3n0c!d3@075 (Complex but could be longer. Time to crack maybe Years)
Very Strong: W3r3!SmYPa55W0rD@9495 ( Long & complex.it should take Centuries to crack)

2.Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Length > Complexity: At least 12 characters long is optimal.
Mix Character Types: Uppercase letter, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols (!@#$%^&*).
Avoid Predictability: Do not use a dictionary word (password), a sequence of numbers (1234), or personal information.
Use Passphrases: Wh3reiSmyCaT@Icantf0undit is both long and memorable.
Unique per Account: Reusing passwords increases your risk.

3.Tips I Learned from evaluation

Substitutions Don't Help Much: P@ssw0rd is still weak (common substitution).
Randomness is Important: Xq2!9zL$r is stronger than Jose123
Tools are Helpful: Password managers can generate/store strong passwords (Bitwarden, LastPass)

4.Common Password Attacks

1.Brute Force Attack: an attacker attempts every possible password combination in sequence.
2.Dictionary Attack: attackers can also be successful if they work through a list of acclaimed passwords and use the first strike found.
3.Credential Stuffing: attackers exploit password reuse. If you reuse a password and it was breached or exposed previously, that password can be used.
4.Phishing Attack: attackers trick you into revealing your password via fake emails or sites that mimic actual companies.
5.Keyloggers can reveal passwords by recording keystrokes.
6.Rainbow Table Attack: attackers work with precomputed hash tables, enabling them to quickly reverse-engineer to figure out your password.
7.Social Engineering: attackers will manipulate or trick you into revealing your password.
8.Man-in-the-middle attack: an attacker can intercept your communication to grab your password.

To defend against these attacks, use strong, unique passwords, and turn on 2FA.

5.How Complexity Affects Security

Entropy: More complexity = more potential combinations = more difficult to crack.
For example: An 8-character password with only lowercase has 208 billion combinations (cracked in hours).
A 12-character password with all character types has 952 different combinations126 billion = decades to crack.
Human vs. Machine: Humans choose patterns that are weak, while machines use them IMMEDIATELY.
